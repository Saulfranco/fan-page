  <h3>The reason why I enjoy Anime</h3>
        <p>I Love Anime because it made me less shy and able to relate to others that watch it also;  <br/>
           Anime also has many games which can help me relax and take some time off from the stress of work. <br/>
          Ever since I was a kid many people would laugh at me because I liked drawing Anime even though I was not good,<br/>
            one day I posted a picture of the drawing on an Anime related website and people liked it.<br/>
         That is why I love Anime it helped me be more creative and positive.</p>
